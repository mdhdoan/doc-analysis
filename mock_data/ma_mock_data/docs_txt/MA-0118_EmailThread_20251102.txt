- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: flagging a potential issue.
- Customer concentration: proposing a working session.
- Synergy model: proposing a working session.
- Synergy model: flagging a potential issue.
Security note: one phishing incident last year; remediation appears adequate but evidence is
