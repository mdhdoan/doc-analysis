Hi Priya,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Supply chain and component lead times: requesting documents.
- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: flagging a potential issue.
- Sales pipeline and channel partners: flagging a potential issue.

Best,
