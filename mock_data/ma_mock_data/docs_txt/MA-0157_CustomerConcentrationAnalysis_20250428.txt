Date: 2025-04-28
Stage: Diligence

Summary:
- Top-1 customer: 26% of revenue
- Top-5 customers: 52% of revenue
- Renewal schedule: two key accounts renew within 12 months

Key observations:
- Contracts often bundle hardware shipments with annual maintenance.
- Price escalation clauses vary; some include caps tied to CPI.

Mitigations:
- Prioritize executive outreach to top accounts within 30 days post-close.

- Build a pipeline heatmap to diversify mid-market segment.

Flag:
- Supply chain exposure: single-source radio chipset with 24–30 week lead times; mitigation
plan needed.
