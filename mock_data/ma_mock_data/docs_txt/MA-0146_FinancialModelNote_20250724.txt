Purpose:
Document key modeling assumptions for the Riverbend acquisition.

Key inputs:
- Revenue: base case CAGR 22% with recurring mix increasing to 53% by Year 3

- R&D: 15% of revenue to support firmware + sensor refresh cycle
- Sales efficiency: payback 17 months; churn 5%

Valuation:
- Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.

Sensitivities:

Risks / mitigations:
- Key risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.
