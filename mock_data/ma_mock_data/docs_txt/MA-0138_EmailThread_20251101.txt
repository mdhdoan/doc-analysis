Hi Grace,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Privacy and data processing: confirming assumptions.
- Employee retention and option pool: confirming assumptions.
- Earn-out metrics and governance: flagging a potential issue.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: requesting documents.
- Customer concentration: proposing a working session.
- Supply chain and component lead times: seeking clarification.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.
Security note: one phishing incident last year; remediation appears adequate but evidence is
partial.

Best,
Avery Patel
HR Director
