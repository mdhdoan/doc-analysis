Hi Grace,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Employee retention and option pool: flagging a potential issue.
- Ip assignment and open-source licenses: flagging a potential issue.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: requesting documents.
Initial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin
volatility.

Best,
Avery Patel
HR Director
