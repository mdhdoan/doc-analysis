Date: 2025-04-11
Stage: LOI

Summary:
- Top-1 customer: 25% of revenue
- Top-5 customers: 52% of revenue
- Renewal schedule: two key accounts renew within 12 months

Key observations:
- Contracts often bundle hardware shipments with annual maintenance.
- Price escalation clauses vary; some include caps tied to CPI.
- Churn risk is highest where deployments are small and channel-driven.

Mitigations:
- Prioritize executive outreach to top accounts within 30 days post-close.
- Offer roadmap visibility and bundle incentives for multi-year renewals.
- Build a pipeline heatmap to diversify mid-market segment.

Flag:
- Security note: one phishing incident last year; remediation appears adequate but evidence
is partial.
