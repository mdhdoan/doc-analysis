Hi Sofia,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Customer concentration: confirming assumptions.
- Employee retention and option pool: proposing a working session.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: seeking clarification.
- Valuation and comps: proposing a working session.
- Regulatory certifications: proposing a working session.
Please route questions through the diligence tracker to keep responses auditable.
Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.

Best,
Caleb Morgan
