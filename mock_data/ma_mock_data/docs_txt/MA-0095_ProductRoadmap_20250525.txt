PRODUCT ROADMAP — COMBINED PLATFORM (DRAFT)
Date: 2025-05-25
Stage: Closing

Goal:
Deliver an integrated sensor-to-analytics offering with secure OTA updates and unified
billing.

Now (0–3 months):
- Stabilize firmware release pipeline; define signing + rollback.
- Integrate Riverbend telemetry stream into Northstar ingestion API.
- Draft pricing bundles and migration plan for existing customers.

Next (3–9 months):
- Release “Fleet Health” dashboard for predictive maintenance.
- Deploy edge gateway option for low-connectivity sites.
- Expand device management features (policy, remote config).

Later (9–18 months):
- New sensor SKU with improved battery life and radio resilience.
- Multi-tenant portal redesign with SSO.
- Advanced anomaly detection models tuned to sensor patterns.

Assumptions:
- The combined roadmap could reduce deployment time for customers by ~30–40% through tighter
firmware-to-cloud integration.
