Hi Maya,

Thanks for the call earlier. Below are a few items to keep momentum.
- Supply chain and component lead times: confirming assumptions.
- Sales pipeline and channel partners: seeking clarification.
- Supply chain and component lead times: proposing a working session.
- Manufacturing yields and qa: confirming assumptions.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.
We modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component
availability impacting shipments.
Security note: one phishing incident last year; remediation appears adequate but evidence is
partial.

Best,
