CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION MEMORANDUM (EXCERPT)
Target: Riverbend Sensorworks Ltd.
Date: October 25, 2025

Customers
Deployments skew mid-market; renewals are tied to replacement cycles and maintenance
contracts.

Key notes:
- Supply chain exposure: single-source radio chipset with 24–30 week lead times; mitigation
plan needed.
- We modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component
availability impacting shipments.
Operations
Manufacturing is outsourced with final QA performed in-house; component lead times are the
primary constraint.

Key notes:
- Potential IP gap: two legacy firmware modules were created by contractors—assignment
paperwork is incomplete.
- Initial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin
volatility.
Product
Riverbend’s platform combines battery-efficient firmware, mesh networking, and secure OTA
updates.

Key notes:
- Key risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.
- Initial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin
volatility.
