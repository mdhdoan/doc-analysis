Hi Sofia,

Following our last discussion, here are the key items we need to align on before moving
forward.
- Supply chain and component lead times: requesting documents.
- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: seeking clarification.
- Employee retention and option pool: seeking clarification.
- Sales pipeline and channel partners: proposing a working session.
Initial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin
volatility.

Best,
Miles Grant
