INDICATION OF INTEREST (NON-BINDING)
From: Northstar Industrial Analytics Inc.
To: Riverbend Sensorworks Ltd.
Date: September 21, 2025

We are pleased to submit a non-binding indication of interest to acquire 100% of the equity
of Riverbend.

Proposed consideration:
- Enterprise Value: approximately $114M, subject to diligence and customary adjustments.
- Structure: cash at closing; potential earn-out tied to ARR and shipment volume.
- Timeline: diligence completion within 6–8 weeks; definitive agreement shortly thereafter.

Key assumptions:
- Continued access to key engineering staff for integration support.
- Confirmed ownership/assignment of firmware and radio stack IP.
- No material undisclosed cybersecurity incidents or data breaches.

Cost synergies are primarily in duplicated back-office functions; revenue synergies depend
on channel expansion into utilities and mining.

This IOI is confidential and non-binding.
