Hi Liam,

Thanks for the call earlier. Below are a few items to keep momentum.
- Regulatory certifications: flagging a potential issue.
- Manufacturing yields and qa: seeking clarification.
- Earn-out metrics and governance: flagging a potential issue.
- Privacy and data processing: seeking clarification.
We modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component
availability impacting shipments.

Best,
Talia Reyes
