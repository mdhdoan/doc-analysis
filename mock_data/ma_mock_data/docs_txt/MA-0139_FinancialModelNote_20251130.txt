FINANCIAL MODEL NOTE — Northstar (INTERNAL)
Date: 2025-11-30
Stage: Outreach

Purpose:
Document key modeling assumptions for the Riverbend acquisition.

Key inputs:
- Revenue: base case CAGR 19% with recurring mix increasing to 38% by Year 3
- Hardware gross margin: 37% (sensitivity +/- 5%)
- R&D: 16% of revenue to support firmware + sensor refresh cycle
- Sales efficiency: payback 14 months; churn 9%

Valuation:
- We modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component
availability impacting shipments.

Sensitivities:
- Component lead times and pricing
- Top customer renewal and expansion
- Earn-out payout probability

Risks / mitigations:
- Security note: one phishing incident last year; remediation appears adequate but evidence
is partial.
