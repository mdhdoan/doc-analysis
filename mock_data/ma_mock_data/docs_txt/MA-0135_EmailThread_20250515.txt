Hi Samira,

Thanks for the call earlier. Below are a few items to keep momentum.
- Synergy model: flagging a potential issue.
- Supply chain and component lead times: seeking clarification.
- Export controls and cross-border shipments: confirming assumptions.
- Export controls and cross-border shipments: seeking clarification.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: requesting documents.
We’ll maintain a weekly cadence: diligence sync on Tuesdays, steering committee on Fridays.
We modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component
availability impacting shipments.

Best,
Sofia Rios
