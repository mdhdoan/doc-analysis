Hi Maya,

Following our last discussion, here are the key items we need to align on before moving
forward.
- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: flagging a potential issue.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: confirming assumptions.
- Valuation and comps: proposing a working session.
- Sales pipeline and channel partners: seeking clarification.
- Export controls and cross-border shipments: flagging a potential issue.
Please route questions through the diligence tracker to keep responses auditable.
Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.

Best,
Renee Alvarez
