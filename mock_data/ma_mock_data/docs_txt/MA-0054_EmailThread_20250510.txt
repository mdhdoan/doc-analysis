Hi Samira,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Regulatory certifications: flagging a potential issue.
- Regulatory certifications: flagging a potential issue.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: flagging a potential issue.
- Employee retention and option pool: flagging a potential issue.
- Export controls and cross-border shipments: proposing a working session.
- Customer concentration: confirming assumptions.
We’ll maintain a weekly cadence: diligence sync on Tuesdays, steering committee on Fridays.

Best,
Avery Patel
HR Director
