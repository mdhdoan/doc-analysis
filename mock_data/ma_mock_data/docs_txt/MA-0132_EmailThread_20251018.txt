Hi Maya,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Employee retention and option pool: requesting documents.
- Manufacturing yields and qa: proposing a working session.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: requesting documents.
- Privacy and data processing: seeking clarification.
Please route questions through the diligence tracker to keep responses auditable.
Initial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin
volatility.

Best,
Devon Price
Operations Lead
