Hi Jordan,

Following our last discussion, here are the key items we need to align on before moving
forward.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: confirming assumptions.
- Synergy model: seeking clarification.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: flagging a potential issue.
- Synergy model: flagging a potential issue.
We modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component
availability impacting shipments.

Best,
