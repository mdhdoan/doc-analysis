Hi Noah,

Following our last discussion, here are the key items we need to align on before moving
forward.
- Sales pipeline and channel partners: flagging a potential issue.
- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: requesting documents.
- Synergy model: confirming assumptions.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.
Supply chain exposure: single-source radio chipset with 24–30 week lead times; mitigation
plan needed.

Best,
Priya Nandakumar
