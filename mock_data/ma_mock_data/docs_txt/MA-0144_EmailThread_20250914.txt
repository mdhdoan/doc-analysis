Hi Ethan,

As we approach closing / Day-1, we want to make sure no operational items fall through the
cracks.
- Privacy and data processing: confirming assumptions.
- Supply chain and component lead times: confirming assumptions.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: requesting documents.
- Earn-out metrics and governance: flagging a potential issue.
- Manufacturing yields and qa: seeking clarification.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.
Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.

Best,
Devon Price
Operations Lead
