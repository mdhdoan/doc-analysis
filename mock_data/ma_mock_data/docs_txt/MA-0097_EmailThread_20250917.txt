Hi Ethan,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Regulatory certifications: confirming assumptions.
- Sales pipeline and channel partners: requesting documents.
- Privacy and data processing: seeking clarification.
- Earn-out metrics and governance: seeking clarification.
We’ll maintain a weekly cadence: diligence sync on Tuesdays, steering committee on Fridays.

Best,
Kara Whitman
