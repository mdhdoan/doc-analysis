CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION MEMORANDUM (EXCERPT)
Target: Riverbend Sensorworks Ltd.
Date: November 09, 2025

Customers
Deployments skew mid-market; renewals are tied to replacement cycles and maintenance
contracts.

Key notes:
- Key risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.
- Initial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin
volatility.
Financials
Revenue mix is shifting toward recurring software/maintenance; hardware remains a meaningful
component.

Key notes:
- Supply chain exposure: single-source radio chipset with 24–30 week lead times; mitigation
plan needed.
- Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.
Market
Industrial IoT adoption is accelerating as operators seek predictive maintenance and remote
monitoring.

Key notes:
- Supply chain exposure: single-source radio chipset with 24–30 week lead times; mitigation
plan needed.
- Initial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin
volatility.
