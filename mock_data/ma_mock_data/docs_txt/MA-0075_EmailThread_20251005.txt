Hi Priya,

Thanks for the call earlier. Below are a few items to keep momentum.
- Customer concentration: requesting documents.
- Supply chain and component lead times: proposing a working session.
- Regulatory certifications: proposing a working session.
We’ll maintain a weekly cadence: diligence sync on Tuesdays, steering committee on Fridays.
Supply chain exposure: single-source radio chipset with 24–30 week lead times; mitigation
plan needed.

Best,
Samira Ali
