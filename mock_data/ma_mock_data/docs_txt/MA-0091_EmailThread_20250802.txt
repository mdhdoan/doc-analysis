Hi Elena,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Manufacturing yields and qa: proposing a working session.
- Synergy model: flagging a potential issue.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: seeking clarification.
- Valuation and comps: proposing a working session.
- Supply chain and component lead times: flagging a potential issue.
- Earn-out metrics and governance: requesting documents.
Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.

Best,
Sofia Rios
