FINANCIAL MODEL NOTE — Northstar (INTERNAL)
Date: 2025-11-05
Stage: Indication

Purpose:
Document key modeling assumptions for the Riverbend acquisition.

Key inputs:
- Revenue: base case CAGR 22% with recurring mix increasing to 36% by Year 3
- Hardware gross margin: 35% (sensitivity +/- 5%)
- R&D: 20% of revenue to support firmware + sensor refresh cycle
- Sales efficiency: payback 15 months; churn 8%

Valuation:
- Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.

Sensitivities:
- Component lead times and pricing
- Top customer renewal and expansion
- Earn-out payout probability

Risks / mitigations:
- Potential IP gap: two legacy firmware modules were created by contractors—assignment
paperwork is incomplete.
