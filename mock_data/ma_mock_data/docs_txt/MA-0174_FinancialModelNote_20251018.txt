FINANCIAL MODEL NOTE — Northstar (INTERNAL)
Date: 2025-10-18
Stage: NDA

Purpose:
Document key modeling assumptions for the Riverbend acquisition.

Key inputs:
- Revenue: base case CAGR 15% with recurring mix increasing to 54% by Year 3
- Hardware gross margin: 44% (sensitivity +/- 5%)
- R&D: 16% of revenue to support firmware + sensor refresh cycle
- Sales efficiency: payback 18 months; churn 5%

Valuation:
- We modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component
availability impacting shipments.

Sensitivities:
- Component lead times and pricing
- Top customer renewal and expansion
- Earn-out payout probability

Risks / mitigations:
- Potential IP gap: two legacy firmware modules were created by contractors—assignment
paperwork is incomplete.
