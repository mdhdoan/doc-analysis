Hi Elena,

As we approach closing / Day-1, we want to make sure no operational items fall through the
cracks.
- Supply chain and component lead times: confirming assumptions.
- Sales pipeline and channel partners: confirming assumptions.
- Sales pipeline and channel partners: requesting documents.
- Valuation and comps: proposing a working session.
- Synergy model: flagging a potential issue.
We’ll maintain a weekly cadence: diligence sync on Tuesdays, steering committee on Fridays.
Potential IP gap: two legacy firmware modules were created by contractors—assignment
paperwork is incomplete.

Best,
Jordan Lee
Director, IT Security
