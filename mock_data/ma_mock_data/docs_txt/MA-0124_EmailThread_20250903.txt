Hi Noah,

Thanks for the call earlier. Below are a few items to keep momentum.
- Export controls and cross-border shipments: requesting documents.
- Regulatory certifications: confirming assumptions.
- Manufacturing yields and qa: proposing a working session.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.
Key risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.

Best,
Liam O'Neill
General Counsel
