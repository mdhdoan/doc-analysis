Hi Priya,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Regulatory certifications: confirming assumptions.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: seeking clarification.
- Manufacturing yields and qa: requesting documents.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: seeking clarification.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: seeking clarification.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.
We modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component
availability impacting shipments.

Best,
Talia Reyes
