Hi Sofia,

As we approach closing / Day-1, we want to make sure no operational items fall through the
cracks.
- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: flagging a potential issue.
- Employee retention and option pool: seeking clarification.
- Export controls and cross-border shipments: confirming assumptions.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.

Best,
Miles Grant
Director, Cedarstone Advisory
