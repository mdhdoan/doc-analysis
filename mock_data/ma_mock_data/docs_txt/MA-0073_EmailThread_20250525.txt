Hi Ethan,

Following our last discussion, here are the key items we need to align on before moving
forward.
- Sales pipeline and channel partners: flagging a potential issue.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: proposing a working session.
- Ip assignment and open-source licenses: seeking clarification.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: flagging a potential issue.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: confirming assumptions.
Initial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin
volatility.

Best,
Caleb Morgan
