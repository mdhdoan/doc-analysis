CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION MEMORANDUM (EXCERPT)
Target: Riverbend Sensorworks Ltd.
Date: November 22, 2025

Market
Industrial IoT adoption is accelerating as operators seek predictive maintenance and remote
monitoring.

Key notes:
- Key risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.
- Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.
Operations
Manufacturing is outsourced with final QA performed in-house; component lead times are the
primary constraint.

Key notes:
- Key risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.
- Initial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin
volatility.
Product
Riverbend’s platform combines battery-efficient firmware, mesh networking, and secure OTA
updates.

Key notes:
- Security note: one phishing incident last year; remediation appears adequate but evidence
is partial.
- Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.
