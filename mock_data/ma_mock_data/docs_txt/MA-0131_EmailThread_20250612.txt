Hi Ethan,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Regulatory certifications: confirming assumptions.
- Employee retention and option pool: proposing a working session.
- Customer concentration: flagging a potential issue.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: flagging a potential issue.
- Regulatory certifications: proposing a working session.
- Ip assignment and open-source licenses: flagging a potential issue.
Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.

Best,
Grace Kim
