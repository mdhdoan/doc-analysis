Hi Liam,

Thanks for the call earlier. Below are a few items to keep momentum.
- Privacy and data processing: requesting documents.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: proposing a working session.
- Ip assignment and open-source licenses: confirming assumptions.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: seeking clarification.
- Manufacturing yields and qa: proposing a working session.
- Synergy model: proposing a working session.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.
We modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component
availability impacting shipments.
Key risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.

Best,
