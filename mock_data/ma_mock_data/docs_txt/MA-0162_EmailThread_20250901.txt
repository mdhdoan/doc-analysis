Hi Priya,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: requesting documents.
- Regulatory certifications: proposing a working session.
- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: confirming assumptions.
- Earn-out metrics and governance: flagging a potential issue.
- Employee retention and option pool: confirming assumptions.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.
We modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component
availability impacting shipments.

Best,
Miles Grant
