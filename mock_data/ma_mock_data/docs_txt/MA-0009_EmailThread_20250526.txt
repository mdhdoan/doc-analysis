Hi Maya,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Synergy model: seeking clarification.
- Customer concentration: confirming assumptions.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: confirming assumptions.
We’ll maintain a weekly cadence: diligence sync on Tuesdays, steering committee on Fridays.
Key risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.

Best,
Kara Whitman
