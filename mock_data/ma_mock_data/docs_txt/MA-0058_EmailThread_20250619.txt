Hi Priya,

As we approach closing / Day-1, we want to make sure no operational items fall through the
cracks.
- Customer concentration: seeking clarification.
- Manufacturing yields and qa: flagging a potential issue.
- Regulatory certifications: seeking clarification.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: confirming assumptions.
We’ll maintain a weekly cadence: diligence sync on Tuesdays, steering committee on Fridays.
Supply chain exposure: single-source radio chipset with 24–30 week lead times; mitigation
plan needed.

Best,
Samira Ali
HR Manager
