CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENT — SUMMARY (CONFIDENTIAL)
Assessor: BluePeak Assurance
Company: Riverbend Sensorworks Ltd.
Date: 2025-04-01
Stage: Diligence

Scope:
- Corporate IT controls (identity, endpoint, patching)
- Cloud services supporting telemetry ingestion and customer portal
- Firmware update pipeline (OTA) and signing practices

Findings (high level):
- Identity & access management: strong for size; MFA coverage 72%
- Vulnerability management: patch SLAs vary; scanning is monthly
- Incident history: two minor incidents, remediated
- Data handling: telemetry contains device identifiers; customer portal stores limited PII

Risks:
- Supply chain exposure: single-source radio chipset with 24–30 week lead times; mitigation
plan needed.

Recommendations:
1) Enforce MFA for all privileged accounts and VPN access.
2) Formalize secure SDLC controls for firmware releases (signing key rotation, peer review).
3) Centralize logging and retention; define incident response playbook.
