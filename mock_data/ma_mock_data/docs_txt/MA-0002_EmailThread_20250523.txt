Hi Maya,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Earn-out metrics and governance: seeking clarification.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: requesting documents.
- Valuation and comps: seeking clarification.
- Regulatory certifications: proposing a working session.
- Synergy model: seeking clarification.
We modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component
availability impacting shipments.

Best,
Talia Reyes
