Hi Samira,

As we approach closing / Day-1, we want to make sure no operational items fall through the
cracks.
- Synergy model: requesting documents.
- Customer concentration: confirming assumptions.
- Supply chain and component lead times: confirming assumptions.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: seeking clarification.
- Export controls and cross-border shipments: flagging a potential issue.
- Customer concentration: proposing a working session.
We modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component
availability impacting shipments.

Best,
Avery Patel
HR Director
Northstar
