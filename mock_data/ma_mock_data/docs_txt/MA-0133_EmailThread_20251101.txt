Hi Avery,

Following our last discussion, here are the key items we need to align on before moving
forward.
- Synergy model: requesting documents.
- Export controls and cross-border shipments: seeking clarification.
- Sales pipeline and channel partners: confirming assumptions.
- Customer concentration: requesting documents.
- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: requesting documents.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.

Best,
Noah Bennett
CEO
Riverbend
