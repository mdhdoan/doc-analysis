Hi Avery,

As we approach closing / Day-1, we want to make sure no operational items fall through the
cracks.
- Supply chain and component lead times: requesting documents.
- Ip assignment and open-source licenses: confirming assumptions.
- Earn-out metrics and governance: confirming assumptions.
We’ll maintain a weekly cadence: diligence sync on Tuesdays, steering committee on Fridays.

Best,
Caleb Morgan
