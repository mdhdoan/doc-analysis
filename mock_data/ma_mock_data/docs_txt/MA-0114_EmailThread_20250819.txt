Hi Jordan,

As we approach closing / Day-1, we want to make sure no operational items fall through the
cracks.
- Customer concentration: flagging a potential issue.
- Ip assignment and open-source licenses: flagging a potential issue.
- Employee retention and option pool: confirming assumptions.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.
Initial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin
volatility.

Best,
