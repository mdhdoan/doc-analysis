Hi Devon,

Thanks for the call earlier. Below are a few items to keep momentum.
- Employee retention and option pool: confirming assumptions.
- Valuation and comps: requesting documents.
- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: flagging a potential issue.
- Supply chain and component lead times: requesting documents.
- Valuation and comps: flagging a potential issue.
- Integration architecture and product roadmap: proposing a working session.
We’ll maintain a weekly cadence: diligence sync on Tuesdays, steering committee on Fridays.
Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.

Best,
Priya Nandakumar
Head of Product
