Hi Avery,

Thanks for the call earlier. Below are a few items to keep momentum.
- Privacy and data processing: requesting documents.
- Earn-out metrics and governance: requesting documents.
- Sales pipeline and channel partners: proposing a working session.
- Earn-out metrics and governance: confirming assumptions.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.
Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.

Best,
Renee Alvarez
