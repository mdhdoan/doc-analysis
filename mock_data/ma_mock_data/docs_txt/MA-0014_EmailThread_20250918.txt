Hi Omar,

Quick update on diligence. We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the
following.
- Valuation and comps: seeking clarification.
- Supply chain and component lead times: proposing a working session.
- Privacy and data processing: requesting documents.
- Regulatory certifications: proposing a working session.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.
Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.
Key risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.

Best,
Avery Patel
HR Director
