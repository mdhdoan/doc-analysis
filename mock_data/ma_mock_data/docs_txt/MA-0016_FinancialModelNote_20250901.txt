FINANCIAL MODEL NOTE — Northstar (INTERNAL)
Date: 2025-09-01
Stage: NDA

Purpose:
Document key modeling assumptions for the Riverbend acquisition.

Key inputs:
- Revenue: base case CAGR 22% with recurring mix increasing to 47% by Year 3
- Hardware gross margin: 44% (sensitivity +/- 5%)
- R&D: 16% of revenue to support firmware + sensor refresh cycle
- Sales efficiency: payback 14 months; churn 7%

Valuation:
- Earn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to
avoid disputes.

Sensitivities:
- Component lead times and pricing
- Top customer renewal and expansion
- Earn-out payout probability

Risks / mitigations:
- Key risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.
