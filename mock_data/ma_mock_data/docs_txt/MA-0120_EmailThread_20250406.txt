Hi Noah,

Thanks for the call earlier. Below are a few items to keep momentum.
- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: requesting documents.
- Privacy and data processing: flagging a potential issue.
- Employee retention and option pool: requesting documents.
- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: confirming assumptions.
- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: proposing a working session.
Redlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline
email edits.
Initial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin
volatility.
Key risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.

Best,
Avery Patel
