We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the\nfollowing.\n- Integration architecture and product roadmap: requesting documents.\n- Regulatory certifications: proposing a working session.\n- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: confirming assumptions.\n- Earn-out metrics and governance: flagging a potential issue.\n- Employee retention and option pool: confirming assumptions.\nRedlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline\nemail edits.\nWe modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component\navailability impacting shipments.\n\nBest,\nMiles Grant\nDirector, Cedarstone Advisory\nAdvisor\n"
