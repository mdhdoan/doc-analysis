We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the\nfollowing.\n- Employee retention and option pool: requesting documents.\n- Manufacturing yields and qa: proposing a working session.\n- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: requesting documents.\n- Privacy and data processing: seeking clarification.\nPlease route questions through the diligence tracker to keep responses auditable.\nInitial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin\nvolatility.\n\nBest,\nDevon Price\nOperations Lead\nRiverbend\n"
