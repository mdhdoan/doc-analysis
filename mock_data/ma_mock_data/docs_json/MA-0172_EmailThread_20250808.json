Below are a few items to keep momentum.\n- Integration architecture and product roadmap: flagging a potential issue.\n- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: proposing a working session.\n- Export controls and cross-border shipments: seeking clarification.\n- Employee retention and option pool: seeking clarification.\nRedlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline\nemail edits.\nInitial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin\nvolatility.\nSupply chain exposure: single-source radio chipset with 24–30 week lead times; mitigation\nplan needed.\n\nBest,\nKara Whitman\nPartner, Pine & Alder Legal\nAdvisor\n"
