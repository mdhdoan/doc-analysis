Below are a few items to keep momentum.\n- Export controls and cross-border shipments: requesting documents.\n- Regulatory certifications: confirming assumptions.\n- Manufacturing yields and qa: proposing a working session.\nRedlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline\nemail edits.\nKey risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.\n\nBest,\nLiam O'Neill\nGeneral Counsel\nNorthstar\n"
