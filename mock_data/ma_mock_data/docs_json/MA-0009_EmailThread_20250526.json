We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the\nfollowing.\n- Synergy model: seeking clarification.\n- Customer concentration: confirming assumptions.\n- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: confirming assumptions.\nWe’ll maintain a weekly cadence: diligence sync on Tuesdays, steering committee on Fridays.\nKey risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.\n\nBest,\nKara Whitman\nPartner, Pine & Alder Legal\nAdvisor\n"
