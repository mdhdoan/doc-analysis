Below are a few items to keep momentum.\n- Privacy and data processing: requesting documents.\n- Integration architecture and product roadmap: proposing a working session.\n- Ip assignment and open-source licenses: confirming assumptions.\n- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: seeking clarification.\n- Manufacturing yields and qa: proposing a working session.\n- Synergy model: proposing a working session.\nRedlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline\nemail edits.\nWe modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component\navailability impacting shipments.\nKey risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.\n\nBest,\nMiles Grant\nDirector, Cedarstone Advisory\nAdvisor\n"
