We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the\nfollowing.\n- Customer concentration: confirming assumptions.\n- Employee retention and option pool: proposing a working session.\n- Integration architecture and product roadmap: seeking clarification.\n- Valuation and comps: proposing a working session.\n- Regulatory certifications: proposing a working session.\nPlease route questions through the diligence tracker to keep responses auditable.\nEarn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to\navoid disputes.\n\nBest,\nCaleb Morgan\nVP, HarborGate Bank\nAdvisor\n"
