We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the\nfollowing.\n- Manufacturing yields and qa: proposing a working session.\n- Synergy model: flagging a potential issue.\n- Integration architecture and product roadmap: seeking clarification.\n- Valuation and comps: proposing a working session.\n- Supply chain and component lead times: flagging a potential issue.\n- Earn-out metrics and governance: requesting documents.\nEarn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to\navoid disputes.\n\nBest,\nSofia Rios\nVP Corp Dev\nNorthstar\n"
