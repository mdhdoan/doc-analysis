Below are a few items to keep momentum.\n- Privacy and data processing: requesting documents.\n- Earn-out metrics and governance: requesting documents.\n- Sales pipeline and channel partners: proposing a working session.\n- Earn-out metrics and governance: confirming assumptions.\nRedlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline\nemail edits.\nEarn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to\navoid disputes.\n\nBest,\nRenee Alvarez\nLead Assessor, BluePeak\nAdvisor\n"
