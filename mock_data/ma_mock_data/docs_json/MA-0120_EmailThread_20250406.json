Below are a few items to keep momentum.\n- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: requesting documents.\n- Privacy and data processing: flagging a potential issue.\n- Employee retention and option pool: requesting documents.\n- Cybersecurity posture and incident history: confirming assumptions.\n- Revenue recognition and arr definitions: proposing a working session.\nRedlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline\nemail edits.\nInitial valuation range assumes 6.0–7.5x forward ARR, adjusted for hardware gross margin\nvolatility.\nKey risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.\n\nBest,\nAvery Patel\nHR Director\nNorthstar\n"
