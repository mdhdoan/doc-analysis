We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the\nfollowing.\n- Valuation and comps: seeking clarification.\n- Supply chain and component lead times: proposing a working session.\n- Privacy and data processing: requesting documents.\n- Regulatory certifications: proposing a working session.\nRedlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline\nemail edits.\nEarn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to\navoid disputes.\nKey risk: top customer accounts for ~22% of revenue; renewal is up in 8 months.\n\nBest,\nAvery Patel\nHR Director\nNorthstar\n"
