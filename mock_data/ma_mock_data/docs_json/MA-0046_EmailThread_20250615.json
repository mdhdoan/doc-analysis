Below are a few items to keep momentum.\n- Supply chain and component lead times: confirming assumptions.\n- Sales pipeline and channel partners: seeking clarification.\n- Supply chain and component lead times: proposing a working session.\n- Manufacturing yields and qa: confirming assumptions.\nRedlines should be consolidated; propose using clause-by-clause comments rather than inline\nemail edits.\nWe modeled a base case with 18% ARR CAGR and a downside case with delayed component\navailability impacting shipments.\nSecurity note: one phishing incident last year; remediation appears adequate but evidence is\npartial.\n\nBest,\nCaleb Morgan\nVP, HarborGate Bank\nAdvisor\n"
