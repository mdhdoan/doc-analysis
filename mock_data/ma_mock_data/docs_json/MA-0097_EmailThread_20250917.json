We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the\nfollowing.\n- Regulatory certifications: confirming assumptions.\n- Sales pipeline and channel partners: requesting documents.\n- Privacy and data processing: seeking clarification.\n- Earn-out metrics and governance: seeking clarification.\nWe’ll maintain a weekly cadence: diligence sync on Tuesdays, steering committee on Fridays.\n\nBest,\nKara Whitman\nPartner, Pine & Alder Legal\nAdvisor\n"
