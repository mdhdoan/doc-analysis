We’re closing gaps in the tracker and would like to confirm the\nfollowing.\n- Regulatory certifications: confirming assumptions.\n- Employee retention and option pool: proposing a working session.\n- Customer concentration: flagging a potential issue.\n- Integration architecture and product roadmap: flagging a potential issue.\n- Regulatory certifications: proposing a working session.\n- Ip assignment and open-source licenses: flagging a potential issue.\nEarn-out triggers tied to ARR and sensor-unit shipments should be defined unambiguously to\navoid disputes.\n\nBest,\nGrace Kim\nVP Engineering\nRiverbend\n"
