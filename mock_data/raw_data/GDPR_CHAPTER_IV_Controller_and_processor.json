Where  a  processor  engages  another  processor  for  carrying  out\nspecific  processing  activities  on  behalf  of  the  controller,  the  same  data\nprotection  obligations  as  set  out  in  the  contract  or  other  legal  act\nbetween  the  controller  and  the  processor  as  referred  to  in  paragraph  3\nshall  be  imposed  on  that  other  processor  by  way  of  a  contract  or  other\nlegal  act  under  Union  or  Member  State  law,  in  particular  providing\nsufficient  guarantees  to  implement  appropriate  technical  and  organisa­\ntional  measures  in  such  a  manner  that  the  processing  will  meet  the\nrequirements  of  this  Regulation.  Where  that  other  processor  fails  to\nfulfil  its  data  protection  obligations,  the  initial  processor  shall  remain\nfully liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor's\nobligations.\n\n5.  Adherence  of  a  processor  to  an  approved  code  of  conduct  as\nreferred  to  in  Article  40  or  an  approved  certification  mechanism  as\nreferred  to  in  Article  42  may  be  used  as  an  element  by  which  to\ndemonstrate  sufficient  guarantees  as  referred  to  in  paragraphs  1  and  4\nof  this  Article.\n\n6.
